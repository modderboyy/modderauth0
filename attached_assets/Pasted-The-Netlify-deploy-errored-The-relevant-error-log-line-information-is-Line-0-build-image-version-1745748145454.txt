Netlify has analyzed the error and provided the following guidance:

**Diagnosis:** The build is failing due to an error in parsing the Netlify configuration file (netlify.toml).

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the `netlify.toml` file in the root of the project is correctly formatted and does not contain any syntax errors.
2. Ensure that the file is correctly named `netlify.toml` with no typos or file extension issues.
3. If any recent changes were made to the `netlify.toml` file, revert them and check if the build succeeds.
4. Double-check the contents of the `netlify.toml` file against the Netlify configuration documentation to ensure it adheres to the correct structure.

If the issue persists:
- Review the [Netlify Configuration File documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/) to understand the correct format.
- Inspect the `netlify.toml` file for any syntax errors or missing required fields.
- If using any specific directives or plugins in the `netlify.toml` file, ensure they are correctly configured.
- Consider creating a new `netlify.toml` file from scratch based on the documentation.

If the build continues to fail, further investigation into the specific content of the `netlify.toml` file may be necessary.
